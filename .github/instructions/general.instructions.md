# Repository Custom Instructions for Copilot

- This is a Rails + Tailwind app. Prefer Rails generators, migrations, and idiomatic conventions.
- Always: update routes, strong params, model validations, and minimal tests when adding features.
- Use Tailwind utility classes; avoid inline styles or custom CSS unless necessary.
- Keep UI simple: use the shared card and button patterns from the layout.
- Default DB is Postgres. Use parameterized queries and ActiveRecord scopes.
